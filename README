This project is a Python-based application for communicating with and monitoring a cellular modem (SIM7070). It provides a clean interface for sending AT commands, 
parsing responses, logging events, and managing serial communication over COM ports. The tool is designed to help developers test, debug, 
and automate modem-related tasks such as reading device information, checking network status, and verifying connectivity.
